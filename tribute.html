            <h2>Godman & Social Worker</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Narayan Vishnu Dharmadhikari</b> (1 March 1922 – 8 July 2008), popularly known as Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari was an Indian spiritual master, social reformer and propagator of Hindu spiritual literature. He initiated his social movement at Revdanda, Raigad district, India.

                The primary mission of his movement was to encourage rationality and eradicate superstition through the elimination of orthodox customs and traditions prevalent among some sections of Indian society.

                He is said to have begun his movement with only 5 followers. During the first days of his movement, Dharmadhikari encouraged his followers to undertake pilgrimage to the most prominent Hindu holy towns in India. There, he instructed his followers to observe the existing social conditions. He believed that these places were littered with sins.

                After pilgrimage, Dharmadhikari founded an organization named Shree Samarth Prasadik Aadhyatmik Seva Samiti. He was an active proponent of the philosophy of the 17th-century Indian saint Samarth Ramdas, who wrote philosophical texts such as Dasbodh, Manache Shlok, and Atmaram. Dharmadhikari has millions of followers around the world.[citation needed] He was awarded by numerous government and social organizations in recognition of his work.[4][5] In 2008, the Government of Maharashtra conferred upon him the Maharashtra Bhushan Award, the highest civilian award in the state.
